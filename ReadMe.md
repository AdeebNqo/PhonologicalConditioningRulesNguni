# Folders

- `/Data`: contains the raw datasets from SADILAR [1] and Ukwabelana [2].
- `/ProcessedData`: contains the cleaned up datasets
- `/Rules`: contains the extracted rules for each language
- `/Lib`: contains a collection of code to assist the extraction of rules.

# Extracting rules

The `ExtractRules.py` file can be used to extract rules. The command `Python ExtractRules.py` will create rules and save them in the `/Rules` folder. Progress of the extraction can be monitored via a logging file called `output.txt`.

# Reading the extracted rules

The `ReadRules.py` file can be used to read the extracted rules that are saved in the `/Rules/` folder. The command `python ReadRules.py` will produce results that look like the following:

    Language = xh
    In combination of wa-i-z-in-gingqi, we apply aizi->ee, and get weengingqi
    In combination of na-u-lu-phuhliso, we apply aulu->o, and get nophuhliso
    ...
